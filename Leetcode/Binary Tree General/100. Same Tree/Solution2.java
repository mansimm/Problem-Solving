/*
ðŸ§  Time Complexity: O(n)
â€¢	The function visits each node exactly once in both trees (as long as structure and values match).
â€¢	In the worst case (trees are identical), all nodes are visited.
âœ… Time = O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the smaller of the two trees (assuming both are the same size, it's just n).
________________________________________
ðŸ§  Space Complexity: O(h)
â€¢	The recursion uses stack space proportional to the height of the tree:
o	Best case (balanced tree): height = log n â‡’ O(log n)
o	Worst case (completely unbalanced/skewed tree): height = n â‡’ O(n)
â€¢	No other data structures are used.
âœ… Space = O(h) where h is the height of the tree.
