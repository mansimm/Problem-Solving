/*
ðŸ•’ Time Complexity
â€¢	In the worst case, we may need to traverse all n nodes, especially when:
o	The tree is unbalanced, and k is near n (e.g., k = n)
o	The desired node is the last visited in inorder
âœ… Worst-case time: O(n)
â€¢	In the best case, we find the k-th smallest element early (e.g., k = 1), and the tree is balanced.
âœ… Best-case time: O(k)
________________________________________
ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity
1. Recursion Stack:
â€¢	The depth of the recursion stack is equal to the height of the tree:
o	Balanced BST â†’ height = O(log n)
o	Skewed BST â†’ height = O(n)
2. Other Space:
â€¢	No auxiliary data structures (like a list or stack) are used.
â€¢	Only a few variables: count, res â†’ O(1)
âœ… Space Complexity:
â€¢	Balanced tree: O(log n)
â€¢	Worst case (skewed): O(n)
