/*
Time Complexity: O(n)
Analysis:
Single traversal: Each node in the tree is visited exactly once
Constant work per node: At each node, we perform O(1) operations:
Pop from stack: O(1)
Increment counter: O(1)
Check and push children: O(1) each
Total operations: n nodes Ã— O(1) per node = O(n)
Result: Linear time complexity where n is the total number of nodes
Space Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree
Analysis:
Stack space: The stack stores nodes that are waiting to be processed
Maximum stack size: In the worst case, we might have all nodes at one level in the stack
Best case: O(log n) for a complete/balanced binary tree
Worst case: O(n) for a completely skewed tree
Average case: O(log n) for a complete binary tree (which this problem specifically targets)
This solution is slow
