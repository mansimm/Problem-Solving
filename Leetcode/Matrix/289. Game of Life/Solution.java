/*
Steps:
Logic:
1.	Iterate over each element of matrix
2.	Find count of living neighbor (1) around it in lives var.
3.	If currents value is 0, then if lives == 3, it will become alive, so we will mark it as -1
4.	If currents value is 1, then if lives<2 or lives>3, it will die, so we will mark it as 2
5.	-1 means going to live (originally dead ie. 0), 2 means going to die (originally live ie. 1)
6.	After all iterations, call update function to update -1 and 2 to 1 and 0 respectively
Count: 
1.	This function counts the number of live cells surrounding current cell
2.	For this we initialize directions array, which gives pairs which we need to add to current [i][j] to get its neighbor
3.	Then we will iterate on direction pairs and add it to current I,j.
4.	We will increment count if element at that neighbor location is 1 or 2
5.	2 indicate that itâ€™s original value was 1, but due to neighboring conditions it going to die, so marked as 2 
Update:
1.	This function iterates over matrix and modify values as follows
2.	If currents value is -1, change it to 1
3.	If currents value is 2, change it 0
